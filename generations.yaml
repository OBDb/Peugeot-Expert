generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 1995
    end_year: 2006
    description: "The original Peugeot Expert was developed as part of a joint venture between PSA (Peugeot-Citroën) and Fiat, sharing its platform and most components with the Citroën Jumpy and Fiat Scudo. Available in panel van, combi (mixed passenger and cargo), and minibus configurations with standard and long wheelbase options. The design featured a relatively compact footprint for urban maneuverability while maximizing interior cargo volume, with sliding side doors and rear barn doors or an available tailgate. Powertrain options included various gasoline and diesel engines, with the latter predominating in most markets, typically ranging from 1.9L to 2.0L, paired with manual transmissions. The interior prioritized functionality with durable materials and straightforward controls, though passenger variants offered improved comfort features. A significant refresh in 2004 brought updated styling, improved engines including a new 2.0L HDi diesel, and enhanced equipment levels. Over its 11-year production run, the first-generation Expert established itself as a versatile commercial vehicle for small businesses and fleet operators, offering a balance of cargo capacity, driving dynamics, and operating costs between smaller car-derived vans and larger full-size commercial vehicles."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2007
    end_year: 2016
    description: "The second-generation Expert continued the collaboration between PSA and Fiat, sharing its platform with the Citroën Jumpy, Fiat Scudo, and newly added Toyota ProAce. Featuring more modern styling with a car-like front end, improved aerodynamics, and a more substantial overall presence. Available in multiple body configurations including panel van, crew van, combi, and platform cab versions, with various length and height options providing increased versatility. The cargo capacity expanded to up to 7 cubic meters with a payload capacity of up to 1,200 kg depending on configuration. Powertrain options centered around HDi diesel engines ranging from 1.6L to 2.0L with various power outputs, all paired with manual transmissions, with later models receiving improved e-HDi engines featuring start-stop technology for enhanced efficiency. The interior saw significant improvements in design, material quality, and available technology, with an emphasis on creating a more car-like driving environment while maintaining commercial vehicle durability. Advanced features for the segment included available navigation, Bluetooth connectivity, and improved safety equipment including ESP stability control. This generation successfully modernized the Expert formula, increasing its appeal to both commercial users and private buyers seeking a versatile people carrier, while improving efficiency, refinement, and technology to meet evolving market expectations."

  - name: "Third Generation (K0)"
    start_year: 2016
    end_year: null
    description: "The current Peugeot Expert is built on PSA's EMP2 platform, shared with passenger cars but adapted for commercial use, and jointly developed with other brands in the group plus Toyota (Citroën Jumpy/SpaceTourer, Opel/Vauxhall Vivaro, Toyota ProAce). Available in three length variants (Compact at 4.6m, Standard at 4.95m, and Long at 5.3m) without height variations, providing flexibility while maintaining a relatively low overall height of 1.9m, enabling access to most height-restricted parking structures. The exterior design features a more assertive front end with higher-mounted headlights, pronounced wheel arches, and an overall more contemporary appearance. Payload capacity increased to up to 1,400 kg with cargo volume ranging from 4.6 to 6.6 cubic meters depending on configuration. Powertrain options centered on BlueHDi diesel engines ranging from 1.5L to 2.0L with various power outputs (95-180 hp), paired with manual or automatic transmissions. In 2020, an all-electric e-Expert was introduced, featuring a 50 or 75 kWh battery pack providing up to 211 miles (340 km) of range on the larger battery version, with 100 kW DC fast charging capability. The interior combines commercial vehicle practicality with passenger car features, including available 7-inch touchscreen infotainment, head-up display, and advanced driver assistance systems. Innovative features include hands-free sliding side doors operated by a foot sensor and Moduwork flexible front passenger seat that can be raised to create additional cargo space with a flat load-through capability. The third-generation Expert significantly advances the model's capabilities in terms of versatility, technology, and efficiency, while the addition of the electric e-Expert variant positions it at the forefront of the commercial vehicle electrification trend."
